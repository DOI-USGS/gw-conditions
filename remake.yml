# The historic data used in 1_fetch has been prebuilt by the 0_historic pipeline.
# 
# The 1_fetch pipeline will download the needed historic data from S3 using the 
#   filenames specified in 0_config. 
# 
# If you need to regenerate the historic data, you will need to build the 0_historic
#   pipeline itself (which is decoupled from the rest of this pipeline). To do so,
#   run, scmake(remake_file = "0_historic.yml")
